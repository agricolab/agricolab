### About me

I am working as a Researcher in the [Institute for Neurotechnology and Neuromodulation](https://www.medizin.uni-tuebingen.de/go/neuromodulation) at the University Hospital Tübingen.

There we research brain stimulation for the treatment of neurological disorders (e.g. Parkinson’s, Stroke). My daily work consists of applying for grants, setting up experiments, supervising students, conducting data analysis, and writing papers. We are mainly performing experiments with EEG, and a multitude of neurostimulation techniques, e.g. TMS, TCS and PES, but also have division for neurorobotics for rehabilitation.

### What i do on github

My activity on github is spread on different organizations. You can find the public repos of our [research group](https://github.com/translationalneurosurgery). For  practical reasons most of my open-source toolboxes are hosted [here](https://github.com/pyreiz). They allow controlling devices for auditory, visual, electrical and magnetic stimulation. There is also a repository for [LuckyLoop](https://github.com/nC-Loop), an embedded real-time stimulation device we develop together with neuroConn, but for IP reasons, most of the code is (still) private. Finally, i am involved in [XDF](https://github.com/xdf-modules) and [LabstreamingLayer](https://github.com/labstreaminglayer) with modest contributions.
