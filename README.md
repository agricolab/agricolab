### About me

I am working as a R&D Specialist at [neuroConn](https://www.neurocaregroup.com/de/neuroconn-technologie), where we innovate and develop medical devices. I support the team with my background in translational neuroscience and professional software engineering.

### What i do on github

My activity on github is spread on different organizations. There are some public repos at our [research groups organization](https://github.com/translationalneurosurgery), but for  practical reasons, most of my open-source toolboxes are hosted [here](https://github.com/pyreiz). They allow controlling devices for auditory, visual, electrical and magnetic stimulation. There is also a repository for [LuckyLoop](https://github.com/nC-Loop), an embedded real-time stimulation device, but for IP reasons, most of the code is (still) private. Finally, i am involved in [XDF](https://github.com/xdf-modules) and [LabstreamingLayer](https://github.com/labstreaminglayer) with modest contributions.
